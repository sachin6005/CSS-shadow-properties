                            GitHub is one of the world’s largest community of developers. It’s an intricate platform that fosters collaboration
                             and communication between developers. GitHub has a number of useful features that enable development teams to work 
                             together on the same project and easily create new versions of software without disrupting the current versions, 
                             but it doesn’t stop there.
